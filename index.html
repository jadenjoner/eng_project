        Over the last semester, I have gained new writing skills, techniques in writing, and different types of presentations. These skills and tactics will be relevant to my life in multiple aspects. The skills that I have gained include the ability
        to persuade by establishing credibility for myself, to make my arguments logically effective, and how to appeal to the audience emotionally. In addition to this, I also am now able to analyze other people’s work and notice rhetorical
        techniques that they are using. Also, I am able to identify my audience and correctly target the audience when writing. These skills transfer over to my personal, professional, and academic lives. Plus, I also know many skills relating to the
        writing process and tips for when I am writing.

      <h2 class="h-border">What I learned</h2>
      <p>
        Out of all the things that I learned from this course, the most important skill I learned was the ability to effectively persuade a specific audience. At the beginning of the course, I discovered ethos, logos, and pathos which are ethics,
        logic, and emotion. This is the framework for effective arguments and that they should be used to appeal ethically, logically, and emotionally. These methods are useful in writing argumentative papers and are applicable in many other areas of
        my life. These skills will benefit my future professional career for things such as business proposals, marketing, advertising, and other forms. Academically, I will be able to strengthen my arguments in academic papers, presentations, and
        when applying for schools. In my personal life, I will use these skills for any sort of persuasion in my conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        While learning skills for persuasion are very important skills for my life, I have also gained experience in the writing process. I gained techniques and skills to more efficiently and effectively create written papers. One of these skills is
        being messy with writing which means not always writing in order and changing the format and topic as you go. Also, I discovered how to find ideas for writing and questions to ask myself when writing. The writing process, as well as effective
        arguments, are essential to professional and business compositions. In a professional position, you often have to convince and explain things to customers and co-workers in speaking, writing, and other forms of presentations. For instance, a
        couple of years ago, I was apart of an architecture internship. My team was constantly presented with problems and questions needing solutions about the project. When I had an idea I tried to convince my team to use the idea and the
        importance of my idea.

      <h2 class="h-border">Professional aspects</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back at that time I realize how much technique there is in persuasion and I know that what I have been taught now would have helped me if I were to do it again. During the Internship, I was apart of creating a mission statement for
        the project we created. These skills I have learned are key to writing mission statements and will no doubt help me in the future. Creating and drafting ideas is sometimes hard professionally but the drafting skills I acquired in this course
        and in the textbook will not be forgotten to help me in the future with my career.

      <h2 class="h-border">Academic aspects</h2>
      <p>
        Not only will I be able to use these skills for business and professional usage, but I will also be able to transfer these skills in my personal life. In my conversations, arguments, and emails, there is lots of skill in crafting them in
        which I can increase my credibility and strength of logical arguments. When I am trying to persuade someone I now know to first explain my sources and reasons for the credibility of my points. Then I present my logical argument and appeal
        emotionally when appropriate. This also applies to emails and how I can format them to make stronger arguments.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="h-border">Personal aspects</h2>
      <p>
        Skills I have learned for arguments and presentations also apply to writing and in argumentative papers. In my academic life, these skills will be very relevant to the ability to write effective papers efficiently and to be able to make
        strong argumentative points. The skills that I will apply to my academic life are the tips that I learned about the writing process in this course. When I do argumentative essays, I will now be able to strengthen my credibility, logic, and
        emotional appeal by my new knowledge from this course.

        No matter what college, career, or personal activities I end up doing, these skills and techniques will be very useful. The skills for the writing process will be very useful for me in my academic future as it will help me write more
        effective papers. Someday will be able to present more effective work to my co-workers and when advertising in my professional life. I can uses skills of persuasion and apply them to my personal life when in conversations or when writing
        emails.
